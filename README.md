# HitSoundChanger
This Plugin allows you to change the sounds used for regular hits and bad cuts
- Currently it looks for a file named `HitSound.ogg` and `BadHitSound.ogg` in the `UserData/HitSoundChanger` Folder, and will replace the corresponding sounds if either/both are present
- Currently it only supports having a single sound for each type of sound, unlike the base game which has multiple different sounds for long/short regular hits
- It's recommended you have approximately 0.2 seconds of silence for HitSound.ogg and no silence for BadHitSound.ogg if you want the sounds to be on sync
- *Make sure the files are actually ogg files, and be prepared to adjust the volume of the files if it's not to your liking*
